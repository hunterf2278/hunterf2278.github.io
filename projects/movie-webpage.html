<h2>Context:</h2>
<p>I was assigned a project with a partner to make our own fictional movie in order to practice the HTML and CSS skills we learned. My partner and I decided to do an action movie in order to excite the audience and keep them engaged throughout the movie. The title of  our movie is “Its-Just-Business.”</p>

                
<h2>Content:</h2>
<p>The first step of my project was to plan what genre our movie would be and what it would be about. Once we did that, we divided the work so that we could complete more, and make sure that each of us knew what to work on if the other was absent. Our story was about two rival companies, Future.Corp and Revolutionary.EC.  Future.Corp created a revolutionary product and Revolutionary.EC steals the blueprints to this product. Now it's up to Agent Viper and Agent Teddy Bear of Future.Corp to get them back.</p> 


<h2>Reflection:</h2>
<p>While completing this project, the challenges that me and my partner faced were adding the images. My partner tried first, but he didn’t understand how to do it. So then we switched roles, and I tried to complete the task. At first, I thought that we just had to find the image, open it in another tab, copy it, and paste the link into the html code, however, my image didn’t appear. So I asked my teacher and he told me that I need to download a screenshot of the image and add it into a separate tab of my pickcode as a png. Then I remembered that the next step is to go back into my html code, and put the link into the  img src=”” code.  I did exactly that and it worked!</p>

    
<p>Another challenge  is that we didn’t know how to make all of our text centered. So, we decided to head back to our CSS FreeCodeCamp Lessons and see how to do it. We eventually did find the lesson and learned that we needed to make a separate class for our body paragraphs. Then  in that class we added text-align: center and it worked. One major takeaway from this project is that planning who was doing what, whether it was CSS or HTML, was a really beneficial technique. I was able to focus on only one task at a time and not worry about  other tasks because I knew my partner was doing them, we would share the workload and it wasn't overwhelming.</p> 

    
<p>If I had more time, I would want to work on a sequel to my movie since I really loved the original storyline and would want to add on to it. </p>
